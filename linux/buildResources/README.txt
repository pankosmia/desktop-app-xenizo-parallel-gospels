#%%APP_NAME%% %%APP_VERSION%% Linux

For first use of any app built on Pankosmia:
  1. Run the server: `.\%%APP_NAME%%` (Or right-click `%%APP_NAME%%` in your File Browser, then "Run as Program")
       This will launch http://localhost:19119 in Firefox (if available) or in your default web browser.
  2. Re-connect to http://localhost:19119 from your web browser as needed.

If unsure, check to see if `~/panksomia_working/` and/or `~/panksomia_repos/` already exist.
  If neither exists, then follow the "First use" instructions above.
  If `~/panksomia_working/` exists, but not `~/panksomia_repos/`, then follow the "Upgrade from versions prior to 0.4.0-rc1" instructions below.
  If both `~/panksomia_working/` and `~/panksomia_repos/` already exist, then follow the "Upgrade from 0.4.0-rc1 or greater" instructions below.

Upgrade from versions prior to 0.4.0-rc1:
  1. Make a copy of `~/panksomia_working/repos` where "~" is the OS user home directory.
  2. Delete `~/panksomia_working/`
  3. Run the server: `.\%%APP_NAME%%` (Or right-click `%%APP_NAME%%` in your File Browser, then "Run as Program")
     This will launch http://localhost:19119 in Firefox (if available) or in your default web browser.
  4. Restore the backup copy from step 1 to `~/panksomia_repos/` such that the prior immediate subdirectories of `~/panksomia_working/repos` are now immediate subdirectores of `~/panksomia_repos/`.
     The resulting directory structure should be along the lines of the following
     ~
     └───panksomia_repos
         ├───_git.door43.org
         │   └───[...more subdirectories]
         └───_local_
             └───_local_
                 └───[...more subdirectories]
  5. Re-connect to http://localhost:19119 from your web browser as needed.

Upgrade from 0.4.0-rc1 or greater:
  1. Delete `~/panksomia_working/`
  2. Run the server: `.\%%APP_NAME%%` (Or right-click `%%APP_NAME%%` in your File Browser, then "Run as Program")
       This will launch http://localhost:19119 in Firefox (if available) or in your default web browser.
  3. Restore backup from step 1 to `~/panksomia_working/repos`
  4. Re-connect to http://localhost:19119 from your web browser as needed.
